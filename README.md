# Wordle Solver
- **Training dataset**: [All possible words that have 5 characters that Wordle takes](https://github.com/3b1b/videos/blob/master/_2022/wordle/data/possible_words.txt)
- **Testing dataset**: [Previous Wordle answers](https://www.fiveforks.com/wordle/)
- **Algorithm**: We will start with using the Bayesian model but we also consider combining other algorithms if necessary

# Works Flow
## Main Goal
1. Random guess from list (whole word list).
2. Feedback based on the letter location (yellow, green, gray).
3. Go back and guess with the feedback information.
## Stretched Goal
1. Find the best word to start.
2. Make it in the web version.
